A code sample of a Spring Boot micro-service for finding the longest palindrome in a string input. 

To run:
Pull the code and double-click start-app.bat, or load it into an IDE of preference. 

This sample contains an example Postman test collection in the main directory named "Palindrome Sample Tests.postman_collection.json".

Notes:
The "demo.sql" file provided under resources was adjusted slightly, for the purposes of adjusting names for clarity, extending the maximum length of a palindrome after dropping the table, and resetting the hibernate sequence after dropping the table.
